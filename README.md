# ðŸ“š Data Science From Scratch

**Welcome to my Data Science journey from scratch!** ðŸš€

Data Science is built on strong **mathematical concepts** such as **Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Statistics**.  
By combining these concepts with **programming**, we can **analyze patterns in data** and **predict future events** based on past trends.

Popular **Machine Learning algorithms** like **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** help us study historical data and make accurate predictions.  
These techniques allow us to solve **real-world problems** across different industries â€” from healthcare and finance to agriculture and technology.

As we go deeper, **Data Science** connects with **Artificial Intelligence** through **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**.  
Deep Learning models, especially **Neural Networks**, help computers **learn from data just like humans do**.  
Today, the most advanced AI models use the **Transformer architecture**, which powers many intelligent systems we see around us.

Through Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, we are building technologies that **transform how the world works**.
